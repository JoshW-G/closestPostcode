# closestPostcode
This a simple postcode checker for schools and gp's based in the LL postcode area in gwynedd. This was part of a uni project and was intended to teach implementing databases so no api's could be used. The code is fairly modifiable and expandable to be able to include more areas and more location types.

Written in Python 3 and uses sqlite and geopy to calculate which distances between postcodes. Currently sqlite db is created when run and the search algorithm could be improved but the existing location list is small.
